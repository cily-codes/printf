ALX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING TEAM PROJECT (PRINTF)--
* This repository contains the code for a collaborative group project that would create a custom made printf function in the C programming language. The printf function is commonly used for generating formatted output in C. The goal of this project is to create our own version of this function from scratch.

Our available conversion specifiers are:

1. %c: Prints a single character.
2. %s: Prints a string of characters.
3. %d: Prints integers.
4. %i: Prints integers.
5. %b: Prints the binary representation of an unsigned decimal.
6. %u: Prints unsigned integers
7. %x: Prints the hexadecial representation of an unsigned decimal in lowercase letters
8. %X: Prints the hexadecial representation of an unsigned decimal in uppercase letters
9. %r: Prints a reversed string
10. %R: Prints the Rot13 interpretation of a string
